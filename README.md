## Introduction

[Regula](https://regula.dev) is a tool that evaluates infrastructure as code files for potential AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes security and compliance violations prior to deployment.

Regula supports the following file types:

- CloudFormation JSON/YAML templates
- Terraform HCL code
- Terraform JSON plans
- Kubernetes YAML manifests
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON templates _(in preview)_

Regula includes a library of rules written in Rego, the policy language used by the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project. Regula works with your favorite CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Circle CI, and AWS CodePipeline; we’ve included a [GitHub Actions example](https://github.com/fugue/regula-action) so you can get started quickly. Where relevant, we’ve mapped Regula policies to the CIS AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes Foundations Benchmarks so you can assess compliance posture. Regula is maintained by engineers at [Fugue](https://fugue.co).

Regula is also available as a Docker image on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fugue/regula).

More information is available at [regula.dev](https://regula.dev).

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

To install Regula via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew tap fugue/regula
brew install regula
```

To upgrade Regula:

```
brew upgrade regula
```

### Prebuilt binary (all platforms)

1. Download the Regula archive for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/fugue/regula/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Move the extracted `regula` binary to somewhere in your PATH:

    macOS:

    ```
    mv regula /usr/local/bin
    ```

    Linux:

    ```
    sudo mv regula /usr/local/bin
    ```

    Windows (cmd):

    ```
    md C:\regula\bin
    move regula.exe C:\regula\bin
    setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\regula\bin"
    ```

    Windows (PowerShell):

    ```
    md C:\regula\bin
    move regula.exe C:\regula\bin
    $env:Path += ";C:\regula\bin"
    # You can add '$env:Path += ";C:\regula\bin"' to your profile.ps1 file to
    # persist that change across shell sessions.
    ```

4. _Windows users only:_ Close cmd and re-open it so the changes take effect.
5. You can now run `regula`.

### Docker (all platforms)

Regula is available as a Docker image on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fugue/regula).

For usage, see [Running Regula with Docker](https://regula.dev/usage.html#running-regula-with-docker).

### From source

_macOS, Linux, and [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) only_

1. [Install Go (v1.16+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. Build binary and move to `/usr/local/bin/regula`:

    ```bash
    make # this builds ./bin/regula
    make install # this builds ./bin/regula and installs it to /usr/local/bin/regula
    ```

Once you've built the binary, execute the following to run tests:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
make test
```
