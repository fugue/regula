kind: Added
body: |
  A `regula` CLI tool with lots of new features, including:
    * Support for HCL source code
    * Built-in OPA and input processing - removes the need for a separate OPA
      installation as well as the Python and Terraform dependencies.
    * Discovery of IaC configurations
    * Additional output formats (an ASCII table, JUnit XML, etc.)
    * A configurable exit status based on rule severity 
    * `test` and `repl` commands which enhance OPA with the Regula library and
      custom rego functions.

    For descriptions of the new features and how to use them, please see our updated
    documentation at https://regula.dev
