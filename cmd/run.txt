Evaluate rules against infrastructure-as-code contained in one or more paths. When run
without any paths, Regula will recursively search for IaC configurations within the
working directory. When a directory is given Regula will recursively search for IaC
configurations within that directory. When a file is given, Regula will assume that the
file contains an IaC configuration. If an input type is set, Regula will only search
for configurations of that type in the specified directories and it will assume that
specified files are of that input type.

By default, Regula will exclude paths based on the patterns in the .gitignore file for
a specified directory. This behavior can be disabled with the --no-ignore option.

Input types:
    auto        Automatically determine input types (default)
    tf-plan     Terraform plan JSON
    cfn         CloudFormation template in YAML or JSON format
    tf          Terraform directory or file

Output formats:
    text    A human friendly format (default)
    json    A JSON report containing rule results and a summary
    table   An ASCII table of rule results
    junit   The JUnit XML format
    tap     The Test Anything Protocol format
    none    Do not print any output on stdout

Severities:
    unknown         Lowest setting. Used for rules without a severity specified (default)
    informational
    low
    medium
    high
    critical
    off             Never exit with a non-zero exit code.
