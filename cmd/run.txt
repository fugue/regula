Evaluate rules against infrastructure-as-code contained in one or more paths.

When run without any paths, Regula will recursively search for IaC configurations within
the working directory or use the input paths specified in your .regula.yaml file if
it exists.

By default, Regula will exclude paths based on the patterns in the .gitignore file for
a specified directory. This behavior can be disabled with the --no-ignore option.
