Evaluate rules against infrastructure-as-code contained in one or more paths. When run
without any paths, Regula will recursively search for IaC configurations within the
working directory. When a directory is given Regula will recursively search for IaC
configurations within that directory. When a file is given, Regula will assume that the
file contains an IaC configuration. If an input type is set, Regula will only search
for configurations of that type in the specified directories and it will assume that
specified files are of that input type.

By default, Regula will exclude paths based on the patterns in the .gitignore file for
a specified directory. This behavior can be disabled with the --no-ignore option.
