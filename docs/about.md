# About

## About Regula

[Regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula) is an open source engine for applying policy as code to infrastructure as code. It's available to developers as a set of open source tools and a CLI.

Regula is the policy engine that powers [Fugue](https://www.fugue.co), a SaaS platform for securing cloud resources across the entire cloud development lifecycle.

### Why Regula?

Regula has the following advantages:

- Supports Terraform project directories, HCL files, and plan files as well as CloudFormation YAML and JSON templates, including those generated by the AWS Cloud SDK
- Advanced rules can evaluate multiple resource types at once and check whether required resources are missing
- Custom rules are easy to write using [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), the policy as code language from [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
- Open-source rules are mapped to CIS Foundations Benchmarks for AWS, Azure, and Google
- Standardized inputs and output reports allow for incorporation into your existing CI/CD pipelines
- Waivers enable you to make exceptions for one or more resources or even an entire IaC file
- Supports disabling rules that are not relevant for your organization
- Seamlessly integrates with Conftest for convenient test running
