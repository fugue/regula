# Regula + GitHub Actions

We've provided an example GitHub Action workflow for integrating Regula and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in a CI/CD pipeline. See the [regula-action](https://github.com/fugue/regula-action) repository for the workflow, and see the [regula-ci-example README](https://github.com/fugue/regula-ci-example#github-action-example) for a walkthrough.
