We've provided an example for integrating Regula and [Scalr](https://www.scalr.com/) in a CI/CD pipeline. See the [fugue-scalr-integration](https://github.com/fugue/fugue-scalr-integration) repository for the integration, and see the [README](https://github.com/fugue/fugue-scalr-integration/blob/main/README.md) for a walkthrough.
