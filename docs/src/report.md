**These are the important bits:**

- [Rule Results](#rule-results)
- [Summary](#summary)

## Rule Results

Each entry in the `rule_results` block is the result of a Rego rule evaluation on a resource. All `rule_results` across multiple CloudFormation and Terraform files and directories are aggregated into this block. In the example above:

- The resource `S3Bucket1` configured in the `../test_infra/cfn/cfntest2.yaml` CloudFormation template (line 3, column 3) passed the rule `cfn_s3_block_public_access`
- The rule `cfn_s3_encryption` was [waived](configuration.md#waiving-rule-results) for the resource `S3BucketLogs` in the `../test_infra/cfn/cfntest2.yaml` template (line 12, column 3)
- The resource `google_compute_firewall.rule-2` configured in the `../test_infra/tf/` Terraform directory (line 6, column 1) failed the rule `tf_google_compute_firewall_no_ingress_22`

## Summary

The `summary` block contains a breakdown of the `filepaths` (CloudFormation templates, Terraform plan files, Terraform HCL directories) that were evaluated, a count of `rule_results` (PASS, FAIL, [WAIVED](configuration.md#waiving-rule-results)), and a count of `severities` (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational, Unknown) for failed `rule_results`. In the example above, 3 rule results were evaluated, of which 1 had a `FAIL` result with a `High` severity.

## Compliance controls vs. rules

What's the difference between controls and rules? A **control** represents an individual recommendation within a compliance standard, such as "IAM policies should not have full `"*:*"` administrative privileges" (CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.3.0 1.16).

In Regula, a **rule** is a Rego policy that validates whether a cloud resource violates a control (or multiple controls). One example of a rule is [`cfn_iam_admin_policy`](https://github.com/fugue/regula/blob/master/rego/rules/cfn/iam/admin_policy.rego), which checks whether an IAM policy in a CloudFormation template has `"*:*"` privileges. If it does not, the resource fails validation.

Controls map to sets of rules, and rules can map to multiple controls. For example, control `CIS-AWS_v1.2.0_1.22` and `CIS-AWS_v1.3.0_1.16` [both map to](https://github.com/fugue/regula/blob/master/rego/rules/cfn/iam/admin_policy.rego) the rule `cfn_iam_admin_policy`.
